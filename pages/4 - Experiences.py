    ## BeiGene
    * BeiGene is a pharmaceutical company that has a primary drug named Brukinsa that treats Leukemia. As an advanced analytics intern, my job was to develop a data-aggregation platform
    that can help my Commerical and Business Operations team to monitor the sentiment of our drug. We worked on aggreagation of data from various sources like PubMed publications, OpenCMS, LinkedIN and Twitter.
    * We synthesized all these information using BERTopic for topic modelling and aspect-based sentiment analysis, to track sentiment of our drug.
    * All these data costs our firm nearly $15K/year, but we were able to automate and aggregate data extraction process and reduced the cost by 10X.
    
    ## Investment Management Club, Kelley School of Business
    * Volunteering on projects related to Machine learning applications for fundamental analysis of equities. Also, taking part in the community and talks to learn about investment research.
    
    ## Graduate Research Assistant, Indiana University
    * Worked on implementing deep Reinforcement learning algorithms for neurogym environments, and compared the neural signals of artificial agents with animal brain signals for neural plasticity

    ## AI4Finance Foundation, FinRL and FinRL-Meta
    * Contributed blog posts, paper explanations, trading demos, and bug fixes for the FinRL library. [Blogs](https://athekunal.medium.com/list/finrl-contributions-59de6997c5b1)
    * Lead the development of end-to-end Hyperparameter optimization and Explainability of DRL algorithms using Shapley Values in the financial world.

    ## Salesken (Machine Learning Internship)
    * Developed a hyperparameter optimization pipeline using Ray tune library for RLlib Reinforcement learning algorithms and improved accuracy by 7%
    * Developed a Politeness modeling pipeline using transformer models from the Hugging Face library. [Politeness Classification project for Stack Exchange and Wikipedia dataset](https://github.com/Athe-kunal/Politeness-Modelling)
    * Build microservices using Docker, Kubernetes, and GCP Platform. Reduced the ready-to-release time from 2 hours to 45 mins through automation in the production pipeline.
    
    ## University of Liege, Professor Damien Ernst
    * Developed a Reinforcement learning trading agent using Google trends data as observation space and achieved 13% improvement in Sharpe ratio compared to baselines across of suit of volatile and crypto assets
    * [GitHub Link](https://github.com/Athe-kunal/Reinforcement-learning-trading-agent-using-Google-trends-data)
    * [Medium Article](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/google-trends-data-for-automated-stock-trading-using-reinforcement-learning-9c0fd6d00678)

    ## OffNote Labs
    * Working on research papers related to the state of the art models in neural networks and their application in image detection and processing. 
    *  Conducted a survey of different loss functions in image segmentation and wrote a research blog post on the same
    * [Survey Article](https://abrasive-headphones-a3d.notion.site/Image-Segmentation-Losses-Classification-842868dc6a7a42d98ee313ea85ff6d06)
