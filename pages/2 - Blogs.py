    ### Deep RL in finance Project with Professor Damien Ernst
    1. [Deep RL using Google trends data](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/google-trends-data-for-automated-stock-trading-using-reinforcement-learning-9c0fd6d00678): The Internet is one of the primary sources of information for financial transactions, and it is more important as more retail investors are entering the market. So, we examined the benefits of having Google trends data as state space for our RL trading agent and we got satisfactory results for stocks like Tesla and cryptocurrencies.
