# Astarag Mohapatra — Profile Website

This repository now contains a fully static, multi-page portfolio for showcasing
projects, writing, coursework, and experience. Each major section of the profile is
available on its own HTML page for easier navigation and future updates.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` directly in your browser or serve the repository with any
static file host. Use the top navigation to jump to dedicated pages for projects,
writing, coursework, experience, and contact information. All styles and assets
are bundled locally under the `assets` directory.

## Legacy Streamlit app

The previous Streamlit implementation is preserved in the `Introduction.py` file
and the `pages/` directory for reference.
