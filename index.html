            Astarag means <strong>Asta</strong> (sunset) and <strong>rag</strong> (red colour) in Odia, my native language.
            I am passionate about building responsible machine learning systems that
            support thoughtful decision-making across industries.

            <p>
              Thank you for stopping by! I am currently working as an ML Engineer at Evidium
              while completing my master's in Data Science at Indiana University. I focus on
              building practical, responsible ML systems that bridge research and impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              My curiosity for AI began in 2018 after watching DeepMind's AlphaGo defeat
              Lee Sedol with its legendary move 37. Since then, I have been building
              projects that explore how humans and intelligent machines can collaborate.
              When I am not working on ML systems, you will find me writing about ideas
              that fascinate me—ranging from AI and technology to economics and curious
              conspiracy theories—or playing John Mayer songs on my guitar. Read more on
