          <h1>Bridging thoughtful research with human-centered AI products</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a Data Science graduate student at Indiana University Bloomington with a focus on
            building applied machine learning systems that make complex information accessible. From
            large language model research to explainable reinforcement learning, I enjoy exploring the
            intersection of rigorous experimentation and human impact.

          <p>
            In 2018, during my sophomore year, I watched DeepMind's film on AlphaGo. The 37th move in
            that legendary match with Lee Sedol changed how I saw the future: it was a human–machine duet
            rather than a competition. Since then I have pursued projects that strengthen the symbiotic
            relationship between people and intelligent systems, from open-source contributions to
            production-grade agents.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Interests &amp; downtime</h2>
          <p>
            Outside of research and product building, I write about abstract ideas, conspiracy theories,
            the future of AI, and economic shifts. You can find my essays and musings on my
            <a href="https://astaragmohapatra.blogspot.com/">blog</a>. I also play the guitar—John
            Mayer's phrasing and tone never fail to inspire me.

          <p>
            I'm currently prototyping agents that blend structured reasoning with retrieval to provide
            auditable recommendations in finance and healthcare. If you're working on alignment,
            evaluation frameworks, or applied ML tools, I'd love to learn from your journey.
